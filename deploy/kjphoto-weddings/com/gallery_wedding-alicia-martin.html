					<p class="galleryText">This is a not-your-typical-wedding kind of story. I received an email from Alicia at midnight on a Saturday, asking if I'd be available the following weekend. She had found me online after deciding that enough was enough - they were going to get married! After a seven-year relationship, Alicia and Martin dove right into wedding planning. </p>
					
					<p class="galleryText">As if one-week wedding planning wasn't enough stress, the couple had been flying around the country due to Martin's work. They're now in Vancouver for one of Martin's digital projects. But before they would officially leave Los Angeles (they hail from South Carolina, even though Martin is <i>really</i> from Manchester and has a really awesome Southern American/British accent that ends up sounding Australian), they wanted to elope in Santa Monica and Venice since they loved it so much!</p>
					
					<img src="assets/galleries/Alicia-Martin_Wedding/Alicia-Martin_02.jpg" />
					
					<p class="galleryText">Martin and  Alicia met for the first time at Nick's Tavern on Sloan Street in Clemson, SC. It was a cold February night, there was ice in the air, but inside Nick's was cozy. They scooted up to the bar for some beers and became instant friends. There was a comfort and familiarity; two old souls reuniting. At the time, Martin was in graduate school completing his MFA coursework and Alicia was working for a local non-profit. In 2009, they decided to move to Los Angeles when Martin was offered a job to work on his first movie. They made Culver City, CA their first home and it will always have a special place in their hearts.</p>
					
					<p class="galleryText">The couple got engaged in August 2012 at Pfeiffer Beach in Big Sur, CA.  They had a celebratory dinner at <a href="http://www.nepenthebigsur.com/">Nepenthe</a>.</p>

					<p class="galleryText">Alicia wore a gorgeous fur stole that still had the original owner's name stitched into it. Martin looked dapper in his vintage-style suit and hat.</p>

					<p class="galleryText">Apparently, they like kicking each other in the bum. It's a sign of their affection (naturally!).</p>

					<p class="galleryText">We roamed about Venice Beach first, soaking in the sights and sounds of odd people doing odder things.</p>

					<p class="galleryText">Martin was thirsting for some authentic Venetian beer. So, we walked into the nearest convenience store on the Boardwalk to check out what was in stock.</p>

					<p class="galleryText">We wandered about an alley and the two found a quiet place to dance. Martin loves grunge and wanted to savor every last bit of graffiti and urban grit as he could.</p>

					<p class="galleryText">Now married, the pressure was off! We wandered about the rose garden and Ocean Avenue for the rest of the afternoon as a light drizzle fell from the clouds.</p>

					<p class="galleryText">Our afternoon ended at the <a href="http://www.georgianhotel.com/">Georgian</a> where Alicia and Martin stayed for their wedding night.</p>

					<img src="assets/galleries/Alicia-Martin_Wedding/Alicia-Martin_47.jpg" />
					
					<p class="galleryText">Since our time together was so short, I asked Alicia how she and Martin spent the rest of their weekend in Santa Monica.</p>
					
					<p class="galleryText">"After our wedding day we were starving and decided to eat at one of our favorite places, <a href="http://www.cotrattoria.com/">C&O's</a>. They have amazing killer garlic rolls that we crave! We sat outside by the water fountain under the heat lamps and drank chianti. When it began to rain they covered us with umbrellas and it was very romantic and quintessentially US! Afterward, we went back to the Georgian, sat on the Veranda and had Irish coffees and reminisced about our day, called friends and family, and began referring to each other as Husband and Wife.</p>
					
				   <p class="galleryText">"On Sunday (the next day), we got up and walked all the way down to where we got married, stopping to take in the scenery and to take pictures. It was nice to revisit our spot beneath the trees looking out over the ocean and up to Malibu. We hope to go back to the Georgian for our one-year anniversary and make that walk again."</p>
